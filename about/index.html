        <br style="color: #333333; width: 60%; margin: auto;">

        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="atkinson-hyperlegible-regular" style="width: 65%;">This is a collection of music that I have written over the course of my
                higher education.</p>

        <h2 class="spectral-light-italic" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><br style="color: #333333; margin: auto;">Inspirations</h2>

        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="atkinson-hyperlegible-regular">As a composer, I take inspiration from other composers and their music. It is difficult to pick a favorite area of music without being too broad or obtuse&mdash;let's call it multivocalic tonal music: music that is comprised of pitches for more than one voice. I tend not to like music that relies too much on unpitched percussion, rhythym, or effects, but these also have their place.</p>

            <p class="atkinson-hyperlegible-regular">Most of the music I draw from tends to have three components: melody, harmony, and counterpoint. To me, the most important of these is counterpoint, as you will see in the following section. I have listed several composers with a description of how I draw from them in approximate order of importance.</p>

        <h3 class="spectral-light-italic" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><br style="color: #333333; margin: auto;">Johann Sebastian Bach</h3>

        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="atkinson-hyperlegible-regular">Bach's vast corups of contrapuntal work is my main inspiration. Many would cite his two books of 24 Preludes and Fugues (48 total) as his primary contrapuntal work, but as I have studied more of his work, I would cite some of his liturgical cantatas as striking examples of masterful counterpoint. I will cite two cantatas in partictular: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSqz9e8DF2s" target="_blank"><i>Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit</i>, BWV 106</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph_NXhlmbjE" target="_blank"><i>Widerstehe doch der SÃ¼nde</i>, BWV 54</a>.</p>

            <p class="atkinson-hyperlegible-regular">The opening movements of both of these cantatas, two of his earlier works, display unique contrapuntal techniques. The former features two mostly-unison recorder parts, with some voice crossing and some striking, half-step and whole-step "neighbour-tone suspensions" (I am combining terminology to describe Bach's unique technique; he alternates between recorder parts, dropping out of the unison pitch to a neighboring dissonance, only to step back into the unison consonance). The latter cantata opens with a striking dominant-over-tonic sound and the melody between two violin parts in stretto and a whole step apart. Due to the way the theme is written, there is plenty of voice crossing between these two violin parts, and there are many unanticipated suspensions, a favorite of mine.</p>
            
            <p class="atkinson-hyperlegible-regular">I would be remiss if I failed to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uX-5HOx2Wc" target="_blank"><i>The Art of Fugue</i>, BWV 1054</a>, and the <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=TMCpjUg411s" target="_blank"><i>Mass in B Minor</i>, BWV 232</a>. I could go on forever about Bach's work, despite how little of it I have actually consumed. On a sidenote, you may notice that I chose a recording of Glenn Gould playing The Art of Fugue; this was intentional. Whenever I discover a "new" keyboard work of Bach's, I try to find a recording by Gould, if one exists. He cares so much about each individual voice. His meticulous style of performance wo target="_blank"uld enhance any work.</p>

        <h3 class="spectral-light-italic" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><br style="color: #333333; margin: auto;">Dmitri Shostakovich</h3>

        <div class="text-container">
            <p class="atkinson-hyperlegible-regular">Contrary to the work of Bach, I am primarily inspired by Shostakovich's Op. 87&mdash;his 24 Preludes and Fugues. The work opens with a tranquil lullaby. The Prelude in C Major is a brilliant study in the idiomatic use of 20th century harmony. The Fugue in C Major to follow is even more brilliant. Not a single black key is used throughout the duration of the fugue, not to mention the simple melody, which could be a traditional nursery-rhyme. Instead of using modulation, Shostakovich creates harmonic and contrapuntal interest by incorporating modal mixture and tight stretti of the theme.</p>
